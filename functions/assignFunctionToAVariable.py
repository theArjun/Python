# First, we define a function named disp
def disp():
    # Then, we assign a variable num to 678
    num = 678
    # Then, we print the num
    print(num)

# To make meet our objective, we need to assign the name of the function to a variable without the parenthesis
z= disp
# Then, we can invoke the function anytimie with the name of the variable followed by a pair of parenthesis
z()
